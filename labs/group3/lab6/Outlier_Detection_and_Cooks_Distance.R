# Outlier Detection using "Cooks Distance"
# Multivariate Regression using Cook's Distance
# Cook's Distance is an estimate of the influence of a data point.
# Cook's Distance is a summary of how much a regression model changes when the
# ith observation is removed from the data.
library(ISLR)
# Let's look at the baseball hitters dataset in ISLR package.
head(Hitters)
dim(Hitters)
is.na(Hitters) # check for the missing values.
# Now we will remove the NA (missing values) using the na.omit() function
HittersData <- na.omit(Hitters)
dim(HittersData) # checking the dimensions after removing the NAs.
glimpse(HittersData)
head(HittersData)
# Now we will implement a multivariate regression model using all the features
# in the dataset to predict the salary of the Baseball player
SalaryPredictModel1 <- lm(Salary ~ ., data = HittersData)
summary(SalaryPredictModel1)
# Multiple R-squared:  0.5461,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.5106

# We see that 18 players have a Cook's Distance greater than 3x the mean.
# Let's exclude these 18 players and rerun the model to see if we have a better
# fit in our regression model.

# Model 2: without the outliers
SalaryPredictModel1 <- lm(Salary ~ ., data = Hitters_Without_Outliers)
summary(SalaryPredictModel1)
# Multiple R-squared:  0.6721,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6445
# We have improved from an Adjusted R-Squared of 0.5106 to 0.6445 with the removal
