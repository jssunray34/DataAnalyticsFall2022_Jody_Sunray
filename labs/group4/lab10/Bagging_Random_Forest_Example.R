# Bagging and Random Forest Example

library(randomForest)
set.seed(1)
bag.boston = randomForest(medv ~., data=Boston, subset = train, mtry=13, importance= TRUE)
bag.boston

# The argument mtry=13 indicates that all 13 predictors should be considered # for each split of the treeâ€”in other words, that bagging should be done.
# How well does this bagged model perform on the test set?

yhat.bag = predict(bag.boston ,newdata=Boston[-train ,])
plot(yhat.bag, boston.test)

# adding the abline()
abline(0,1)
mean((yhat.bag-boston.test)^2)

# The test set MSE associated with the bagged regression tree is 13.16, #almost half that obtained using an optimally-pruned single tree.
#We could change the number of trees grown by randomForest() using the ntree argument:
bad.boston =
  bag.boston=randomForest(medv~.,data=Boston,subset=train, mtry=13,ntree=25)
yhat.bag = predict(bag.boston ,newdata=Boston[-train ,])
mean((yhat.bag-boston.test)^2)

set.seed(1)
rf.boston=randomForest(medv~.,data=Boston,subset=train,
                                   mtry=6,importance =TRUE)
yhat.rf = predict(rf.boston ,newdata=Boston[-train ,])
mean((yhat.rf-boston.test)^2)

# The test set MSE is 11.31;
# this indicates that random forests yielded an improvement over bagging in this case.
# Using the importance() function, we can view the importance of each variable.

importance (rf.boston)
# Two measures of variable importance are reported.
#The former is based upon the mean decrease of accuracy in predictions on
# the out of bag samples when a given variable is excluded from the model.
#The latter is a measure of the total decrease in node impurity that results
# from splits over that variable, averaged over all trees.

# In the case of regression trees, the node impurity is measured by the training RSS,
# and for classification trees by the deviance.
# Plots of these importance measures can be produced using the varImpPlot() function.
