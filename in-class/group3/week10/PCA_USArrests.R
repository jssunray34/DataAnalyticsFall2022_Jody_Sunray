# In this lab, we perform PCA on the USArrests data set, which is part of the
# base R package.

#The rows of the data set contain the 50 states, in alphabetical order.
# We will use the USArrests data that available on RStudio
data("USArrests")
help("USArrests") # Read thee documentation of USArrest data on RStudio.

states=row.names(USArrests)
states

# The columns of the data set contain the four variables.
names(USArrests)

# We first briefly examine the data. We notice that the variables have vastly
# different means.
# Note that the apply() function allows us to apply a function—in this case,
# the mean() function
# to each row or column of the data set.
# The second input here denotes whether we wish to compute the mean of
# the rows, 1, or the columns, 2.
# We see that there are on average three times as many rapes as murders,
#and more than eight times as many assaults as rapes.
apply(USArrests, 2, mean)

# We can also examine the variances of the four variables using the apply()
# function.
apply(USArrests, 2, var)

# Not surprisingly, the variables also have vastly different
# variances: the UrbanPop variable measures the percentage of
# the population
# in each state living in an urban area, which is not a
# comparable number to the number of rapes in each state per
# 100,000 individuals.
# If we failed to scale the variables before performing PCA,
# then most of the principal components that we observed
# would be driven by the Assault variable,
# since it has by far the largest mean and variance. Thus, it is
# important to standardize the variables to have mean zero and
# standard deviation one before performing PCA.

# We now perform principal components analysis using the prcomp() function, which is one of several functions in R that
# perform PCA.
# By default, the prcomp() function centers the variables to have mean zero. By using the option scale=TRUE,
# we scale the variables to have standard deviation one.
# The output from prcomp() contains a number of useful quantities.
pr.out=prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
names(pr.out)
# The center and scale components correspond to the means and standard deviations of the
# variables that were used for scaling prior to implementing PCA.
pr.out$center
pr.out$scale
# The rotation matrix provides the principal component loadings; each column of pr.out$rotation contains
# the corresponding principal component loading vector
# We see that there are four distinct principal components.
pr.out$rotation

# Using the prcomp() function, we do not need to explicitly multiply the data by
# the principal component loading vectors in order to obtain the principal component score
# vectors.
# Rather the 50 × 4 matrix x has as its columns the principal component score vectors.
# That is, the kth column is the kth principal component score vector.
dim(pr.out$x)
# We can plot the first two principal components as follows:
biplot(pr.out, scale=0)
# The scale=0 argument to biplot() ensures that the arrows are scaled to represent the
# loadings;
# other values for scale give slightly different biplots with different interpretations.
# The prcomp() function also outputs the standard deviation of each principal component.
# For instance, on the USArrests data set, we can access these standard deviations as follows:
pr.out$sdev

# The variance explained by each principal component is obtained by
# squaring these:
pr.var <- pr.out$sdev^2
pr.var
# To compute the propotion of variance explained by each principal
# component, we simply
# devide the variance explained by each principal component by the total
# variance explained
# by all four principal components.
pve <- pr.var/sum(pr.var)
pve
# We cab see the first principal component explains 62.0% of the variance
# in the data.
# The next principal component explains 24.74% of the variance, and so
# forth...
